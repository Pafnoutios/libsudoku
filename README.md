# libsudoku

A C++ library for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles.

Puzzles are solved with the logic a human solver would use.
This is to measure the difficulty of the puzzle
by the hardest technique required.

Puzzles of any size are supported,
but the algorithms are designed for optimal performance
on standard 9-digit and 16-digit puzzles.
